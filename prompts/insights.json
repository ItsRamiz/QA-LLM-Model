Do not show calculations, reasoning, or explanations. Do not write any text besides the number. Respond with only the integer.",
    "execution_time": "You are a precise data analysis tool. Read the provided dataset and sum the execution times of all tests in seconds. Respond with ONLY the total time as a number followed by the word 'seconds'. Do not explain, do not list tests, and do not show steps. Output must be a single short value.",
    "pass_rate": "You are a precise data analysis tool. Calculate the pass rate using the formula: (Passed tests / Total tests) × 100. Return ONLY the percentage with a '%' sign. Do not show formulas, steps, or explanations. The answer must be a single value like '87.3%'."
